First some theory. What is:

-    An atomic operation?

An operation during wich a processor can simultaneously read allocations and write it in the same
operation. This prevents all other devices from writing and reading until it is complete.

-    A semaphore?

It is a variable or abstract data type that is used for controlling access by multiple processes to a
common resource in a parallel program.

-    A mutex?

It gives exclusive access to a location to a process, and organize the queue.

-    A critical section?

It is a section that must not be concurrently accessed by more than one thread of execution.
