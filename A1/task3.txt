Why do we use concurrent execution (multithreading/multiprocessing, or the like)? List a fair few reasons.

- So we can run parallel multiple threads in one process.
- Make more use of todays multicore processor.



-   How can adding more concurrent tasks make programming simpler? (Think about translation from idea to code...)


- Accessing small I/O devices.
- Serving multiple network clients.


-   And how can it make programming more difficult? (Maybe come back to this after you have worked on part 4 of this exercise)
